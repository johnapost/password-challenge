Getting Started
---------------
You will need Node.JS and NPM.

Download Node.JS [here](http://nodejs.org/) for your OS. NPM comes with Node.JS.

Enter the following in your console when pointed at the project directory:
```npm i```

Usage
-----
```npm start```

Notes
-----
* Uses the local dictionary ('/usr/share/dict/words').
* 's0_0per 5nak3' returns 36, because 'nak' is in the dictionary.
